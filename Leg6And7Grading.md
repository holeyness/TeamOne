####Leg 6

10/10.

You went for the full real time solution. To be honest, I would have 
liked to have seen you implement something from scratch so that you can see
the work that goes in to it, but this API you've found is impressive!

####Leg 7

2/10

####Notes

You have an RSA private key live in your repo. Why?

You have multiple instances of secret keys relating to your pusher account
in the open. Why?
