## Leg 1 Grading

### Tyler's Notes

1. I like that this is done with privacy in mind. This is really great.
1. Unfortunate that your horizontal scrolling went second, it could have been pretty unique.
1. This admins-only posting thing is going to be contentious. I would make sure this works well, it could be really cool.

### Class Questions

1. How do you decide what is important to me?
  * The ones I follow, freshness, likes, comments

1. URL field is too short

1. What is the difference between admins and users?
  * Admins are the only ones allowed to post. Users can just view.

1. How are you deciding admins?
  * Not sure yet. The site owner will have to curate.

1. Who is the original admin?
  * The person that owns the site. 
  * Be careful that "site owners" may not be technical people. They won't want to set up a server.

1. Why is there a read-only permission?
  * In case you're not sure that you want to post yet

### Grade

1. Presentation: 5/5. You had thought out answers to the questions and presented very well.

1. Project: 10/10. Your schema is well designed and should allow for expansion if necessary. Be careful about overcomplicating before necessary. Maybe add some of these tables later down the line, when you actually need them.
